* Yet Another Lisp
Another Lisp interpreter. This is based off the other one in my repository, but this one is written in C99 instead of C++11. I'm hoping to get this onto one of the microcontrollers I'm using in a class. Right now the implementation is fubar and only prints out a parse tree.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make
./lisp
#+END_SRC
